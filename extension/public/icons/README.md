# Placeholder for extension icons
# In production, these would be proper PNG files

# For now, we'll create simple text files as placeholders
# Real icons should be:
# - icon-16.png (16x16)
# - icon-32.png (32x32) 
# - icon-48.png (48x48)
# - icon-128.png (128x128)

# You can generate these icons using online tools or design software
# Icon should represent the "Magic Button" concept - maybe a wand or sparkle
